# Bachelor-Projects
Repository of my bachelor course projects

In this repo you will find most of the projects I completed for my bachelors degree in computer science at the University of Tehran.

Among these there may exist content that will be part of some course projects in the future. Eventhough all students are welcome to take ideas from my work, I kindly ask you to not copy my work in its entirety, as your own project. Also if your course requires you to not look at other projects before doing it yourself, please don't violate that rule using my work.
Everyone is welcome to use any content here with or without mentioning me, if there are no limitations from third parties.

You can contact me at <p.tasbihgou@gmail.com>.
